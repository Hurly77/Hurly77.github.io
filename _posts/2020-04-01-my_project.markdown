For my project, I did a “Rick and Morty” CLI and it was fun it really was but, it was not one of my most simple accomplishments.  I had built this project up in my mind, thinking I was literally going to be doing rocket science but, to my surprises I quite actually enjoyed it. Though it was fun I wouldn’t put my project in the category of perfect. To me this is all been a learning experience, go figure right. What I really mean to say is that is has been the most rewarding of what I’ve done so far.
When I first looked at my blank text editor I was lost and it felt that way for a couple of days, I knew what I wanted to do but it was the how. The how is what this is all about. I’ve been writing code for about 3 months now and, it wasn’t until this project that I felt like I really had a handle on all the concepts. Of course, I do have a theory for all of this and, as obvious as it sounds, its because you have to really engage.
Engaging in your work is rare and, it is one of the reasons why Time passes so fast when your coding. First of all, when I’m reading, watching videos or copying code through a code along 80% of the time I’m uncontrollably daydreaming. This is because I don’t learn unless I’m challenged with a task and, for me at least, the is super charged by the fact the I have creative control. Anyway it was a great project and I had fun, here is to passing my review
